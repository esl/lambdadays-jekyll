### Andrea Magnorsky

Developer and co-founder (BatCat Games)  

I ended up as a Software Developer, I am pretty sure there was no other viable option. My current technical interests are F#, games, programming languages and philosophy of computing .  
  
I really enjoy finding different ways to write code, sometimes for performance, other times for succinctness, sometimes, just because you can, there is no better way to learn than trying.  
  
When I am not working I tend to play with other languages or cats  
  
Conferences and meetups are a great way to learn more, so I try to help when I can to make them happen. For that reason I co-organise Functional Kats and GameCraft. I also speak at local and international conferences like CodeMesh, Progressive.Net, ProgF#, Lambda Days and many more.

#### The Tools that Shape Us

Making great games is all about fast iteration. Giving the designers and content creators the ability to quickly test an idea and then grow that idea organically is critical to finding the fun. That means that we as developers need to make tools that make their workflows as painless and transparent as possible.  
  
Over the last year, we have been using F# in our game and this talk is a short reflection on how that has turned out.  
  
We'll talk about: the language, the ecosystem, the tooling and the community with live examples from the game and the tool chain
