### Marek Kubica

Language explorer  

Marek studies Computer Science at Technische Universität München and has a personal faible for learning programming languages. On his journey through the history of computing he has encountered many interesting design concepts. When not staring at blinking screens, he enjoys taking photographs or riding his road bike. You can read is blog at xivilization.net or laugh at his silly quips on Twitter, @leonidasfromxiv.

#### Brave New OCaml World

With industry adoption rising, startups picking it, new books being written and released, the underdog of statically typed functional programming languages, OCaml, is rapidly changing for the better. 2015 might be the year for you to pick it up. We will mention some of the reasons, OCaml might be just what you have been missing out on. As the ecosystem has grown organically, there is a lot of things building on top of each other that might be confusing to a newcomer and there is not yet a “standard way of doing things”. We will describe how to start an OCaml project: what tools are available, how to structure code, what libraries are available, editor integration, community support (IRC and mailing lists), documentation, continuous integration. We will also take a look at what's still lacking.
