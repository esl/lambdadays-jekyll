#### Dissecting the Rabbit: RabbitMQ Internal Architecture

The talk aims to show how RabbitMQ uses Erlang/OTP to build a message broker. We will go through ""a day in the life of a message"" to explore the different patterns used by RabbitMQ to handle message ingres, routing and message delivery.  
  
We are going to go over areas like:  
  
\- How Erlang Pattern Matching is used to implement the AMQP protocol.  
\- RabbitMQ Boot System: How does the broker boots until it's ready to accept messages.  
\- A day in the life of a message: The path a message takes while passing across RabbitMQ.  
\- Flow Control for Erlang Processes and the Credit Flow implementation.  
\- Supervisor Trees, RabbitMQ own behaviours and more.
