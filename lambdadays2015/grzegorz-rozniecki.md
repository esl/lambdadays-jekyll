#### Weird world of continuations

Meet CPS (continuation-passing style) reality where return is passé, goto is disguised in elegant, functional manner and stack overflow is defeated by tail call optimization. See how CPS works (or not) in Perl, JavaScript, some Lisp dialect and few other languages. Discover what impact have the idea from 1970s had on modern programming techniques. Come and hear about all this stuff from a guy who actually used CPS in production application.
