### Adam Warski

SoftwareMill  

I am one of the co-founders of SoftwareMill, where I code mainly using Scala and other interesting technologies. I am involved in open-source projects, such as Macwire, Quicklens, ElasticMQ and others. I have been a speaker at major conferences, such as JavaOne, Devoxx and ScalaDays.  
  
Apart from writing closed- and open-source software, in my free time I try to read the Internet on various (functional) programming-related subjects, any ideas or insights usually end up on my blog.

#### Implementing the Reactive Manifesto with Akka

It’s certainly fashionable to “be reactive”, but what does it mean? How does reactive look in practice? Akka contains a number of more or less experimental modules, with which we can create a \[Responsive, Resilient, Elastic, Message driven\]-application. We will see how various Akka features help in implementing the above traits. The presentation will contain a short introduction to the reactive ideology, and then we will try to write a reactive application using Akka Cluster, Akka Streams and Akka Persistence.
