#### Building a System in Clojure

In this talk I will present my [BirdWatch](https://github.com/matthiasn/BirdWatch) project , a system I'm building in order to discover patterns for developing distributed applications for reasoning over streaming data in Clojure and ClojureScript. It also also the sample application in the book I'm currently working on: [leanpub.com/building-a-system-in-clojure](https://leanpub.com/building-a-system-in-clojure)  
Previous incarnations of this application have been in Scala with an AngularJS frontend, but I fell out of love with these technologies and have more fun with the Clojure ecosystem now.
