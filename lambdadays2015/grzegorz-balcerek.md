### Grzegorz Balcerek

Functional programming enthusiast, author of “Elm by Example”  

Grzegorz is a software developer interested in functional programming and languages that facilitate programming in a functional and type-safe way, such as Scala, Haskell or Elm.  He is the author of “Elm by Example” and “Język programowania Scala”.

#### Elm. Functional, Reactive, for the Web

Elm is a relatively young, statically-typed functional programming language. It is a language for Web programming. Elm programs are compiled to JavaScript, HTML and CSS and can be displayed (run) in web browsers. Elm is an attempt to use the Functional Reactive Programming idea and make Web programming experience different from what many developers are used to today. The presentation is an introduction to the language. It will present code examples and hopefully let the audience gain some understanding of how programming in Elm looks like​.​
