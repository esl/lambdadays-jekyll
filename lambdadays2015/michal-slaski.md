#### Lessons from Erlang VM

In this talk we will discuss designing systems on Erlang VM. One of the reasons why the Erlang and Elixir languages attract attention of developers, is that they have to solve certain type of problems arising in concurrent systems.  
  
We will take a look at the real tools Erlang VM gives you to write highly-available systems that let you sleep through the night: dynamic tracing and remote REPL.  
  
We'll see how these tools are used.
