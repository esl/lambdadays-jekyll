#### Ada Lovelace: The first functional programmer

Ada Lovelace work on Charles Babbage's Analytic Engine was far ahead of her time. She matured the concept of an automatic calculator by writing source code for a machine that was not even build.  
  
In this session we will take a closer look into that code and how it works. We will provide operational details of the Analytic Engine and learn how it can be programmed.  
  
We will even discover if Ada Lovelace was perhaps the first functional programmer.
