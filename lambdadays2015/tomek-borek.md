#### Why bother with FP?

Instead of just bashing other paradigms I'll provide real arguments for FP, backed  
I’ll talk about:

*   complexity, accidental and essential
*   state manipulation / mutation
*   pure OOP model (Smalltalk, though model is quite language agnostic)

  
Most of FP hype lately bothers me, so I'll try to illuminate why FP matters in a way that avoids hype and buzzwords and is based on facts / research / CS papers. Good OOP will be mentioned as well with hopes that attendees will see it’s quite similar.  
  
There's a number of talks / posts / articles now that tell you how it's great and why. These talks usually don't offer any data, they are rather based on particular experience like ""in my project, we did FP and it worked"". Or they start with bashing OOP, telling how it sucks, when they did OOP wrong  
  
Instead of bashing, I'll outline few things which make FP interesting, without the hype and the ""you must be FP otherwise you're not a REAL programmer""  
  
Talk will be backed by research and studies about each and every claim

*   FP?
*   Why such talk
*   Other paradigms
*   Complexity
*   State mutation
*   Streams
*   Concurrency
*   Hybrid approaches
*   How good OOP works similarly to good FP
