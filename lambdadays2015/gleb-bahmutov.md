#### Journey from procedural to reactive JavaScript with stops

How do we convince / train developers used to imperative programming style to switch to functional or even reactive programming? I show the same example implemented in multiple styles to highlight the advantages one would get by going from imperative to object-oriented, functional, lazy evaluation, promise-based, event emitters, and finally reactive approach.  
  
The short examples are in JavaScript - the most widely used functional language today.
