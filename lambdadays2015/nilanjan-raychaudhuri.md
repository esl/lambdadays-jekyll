#### You say big data, I say Fast data

Nowadays most of the "Big Data" problems are dealing with speed not size. Folks want "Fast Data". Speed is the problem to solve, not size. Most organizations today actually face smaller big data problems that they are trying to address through in-memory cached real-time processing of data. In this presentation we will explore architectures used for solving "Fast Data" problems.  
  
   
We will be using Spark Streaming and Scala for code examples.
