#### Is it possible to run Erlang on 32 kilobytes of RAM?

Some people think of Erlang as a language of choice for programming embedded devices.  
  
This assumption might stem from how the language originated or from the recent attempts to reduce the learning curve for embedded programming.  
  
In this talk I'd like to report on the progress made trying to fit as many Erlang Virtual Machine elements as possible on a microcontroller containing merely 32 kilobytes of RAM.  
The goal is to explore the ramifications that need to be taken into consideration when using such a high-level language on such a device.
